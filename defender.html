        <!--Blog content-->
        <div class="main-blog">The Auto Express Best Luxury Car award is the second major honour for the New Range Rover
            in a matter of months, having received the Reader Award at the What Car? Car of the Year Awards in January.
            For the second year in a row, the Land Rover Defender was also recognised by Auto Express, as 2022â€™s Best
            Large Premium SUV.

        <div class="main-blog">The fifth-generation Range Rover was launched earlier this year, reinvented with a focus
            on modern luxury, thanks to a blend of breath-taking modernity, peerless refinement and unmatched
            capability. It offers more customer choice than ever before with four, five or seven-seat interiors across
            Standard or Long Wheelbase body designs, and is available with a selection of powertrains, including an
            extended-range plug-in electric hybrid, producing CO2 emissions as low as 18g/km and providing up to 70
            miles of EV range.
